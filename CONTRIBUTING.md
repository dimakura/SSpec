# Contribute to SSpec

As `SSpec` is a young project, there is still a lot of things to do.

* Development issues/features can be [found here](https://github.com/dimakura/SSpec/issues);
* We lack good documentation, so you can help with this;
* If you can help with designing `SSpec` web page this would be really helpful.

Also feel free to come with your own ideas how to make `SSpec` even better.
